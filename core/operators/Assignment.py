Assignment/Shorthand Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables.

• = : Assignment (e.g., a = b)
• += : Add and assign (e.g., a += b)
• -= : Subtract and assign (e.g., a -= b)
• *= : Multiply and assign (e.g., a *= b)
• /= : Divide and assign (e.g., a /= b)
• //= : Modulus and assign (e.g., a %= b)
• **= : Bitwise AND and assign (e.g., a &= b)
