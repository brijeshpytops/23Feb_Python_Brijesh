Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two operands and return a boolean value (true or false).

• == : Equal to (e.g., a == b)
• != : Not equal to (e.g., a != b)
• > : Greater than (e.g., a > b)
• < : Less than (e.g., a < b)
• >= : Greater than or equal to (e.g., a >= b)
• <= : Less than or equal to (e.g., a <= b)
