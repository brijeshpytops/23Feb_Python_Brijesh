Welcome to Python 3.12's help utility! If this is your first time using
Python, you should definitely check out the tutorial at
https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To get a list of available
modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, enter "modules", "keywords",
"symbols", or "topics".

Each module also comes with a one-line summary of what it does; to list
the modules whose name or summary contain a given string such as "spam",
enter "modules spam".

To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter,
enter "q" or "quit".

4] help> keywords

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not



False: Represents the boolean value for "false."
None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
True: Represents the boolean value for "true."
and: Logical operator used to combine conditional expressions, returning True if both operands are true.
as: Used to create an alias for a module or to handle exceptions with a specific variable name.
assert: Used for debugging; tests if a condition is true and raises an AssertionError if not.
async: Declares an asynchronous function which can use await for non-blocking calls.
await: Pauses the execution of an async function until the result of the awaited coroutine is available.
break: Exits the current loop prematurely.
class: Defines a new user-defined class in Python.
continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
def: Defines a new function or method.
del: Deletes objects, variables, or list elements.
elif: Specifies a new condition to test if the previous conditions were false.
else: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the previous conditions are false.
except: Catches and handles exceptions raised by the try block.
finally: Executes a block of code after a try block, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.
for: Initiates a loop that iterates over a sequence (like a list or range).
from: Imports specific attributes or functions from a module.
global: Declares that a variable is global, allowing access to it throughout the module.
if: Tests a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
import: Imports a module into the current namespace.
in: Checks if a value is present in a sequence (like a list or string).
is: Tests for object identity; checks if two variables point to the same object.
lambda: Creates an anonymous function.
nonlocal: Allows assignment to a variable in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.
not: Logical operator that inverts the boolean value of its operand.
or: Logical operator that returns True if at least one operand is true.
pass: Acts as a placeholder; does nothing and is often used as a stub for future code.
raise: Triggers an exception manually.
return: Exits a function and optionally passes back a value to the caller.
try: Initiates a block of code to attempt to run, followed by handling exceptions with except.
while: Starts a loop that continues as long as the condition is true.
with: Simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks.
yield: Pauses the function saving its state and later continues from where it left off, used in generator functions.
